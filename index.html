    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This article explores a dataset from arXiv (arXiv.org), an open-access archive for nearly 2.4 million scholarly articles across various disciplines, including physics, mathematics, computer science, and quantitative biology. This study focuses on the High Energy Physics Theory (HEP-TH) section, covering papers from January 1993 to April 2003. The dataset includes 27,770 papers and 352,807 citations, representing a near-complete record of HEP-THâ€™s early contributions.</p>
        <p>We analyze this dataset as a citation network, where nodes represent papers and directed edges signify citations from one paper to another. By examining this network, we uncover patterns of influence, community structures, and citation behaviors that provide insights into the collaborative nature and research trends within the HEP-TH domain.</p>

    <!-- Data Loading Section -->
    <section id="loading-data">
        <h2>Chapter 1: Loading the Data</h2>
        <p>In this section, we load and prepare the dataset using NetworkX, a Python library designed for the analysis of complex networks. The dataset consists of a list of citations where each entry connects a citing paper to a cited paper. Using NetworkX, we represent this data as a directed graph where each node is a paper, and each directed edge signifies a citation from one paper to another.</p>
        <p>Number of papers (nodes): 27,770<br>Number of citations (edges): 352,807</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2: Analyzing the Data</h2>
        
        <!-- Degree Centrality Analysis -->
        <h3>2.1 Degree Centrality Analysis</h3>
        <p>We begin by analyzing degree centrality, which helps us identify the most cited papers (in-degree) and the most citing papers (out-degree).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Top 10 Most Cited Papers:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Paper 9711200: Cited by 2,414 papers</li>
                <li>Paper 9802150: Cited by 1,775 papers</li>
                <li>Paper 9802109: Cited by 1,641 papers</li>
                <li>Paper 9407087: Cited by 1,299 papers</li>
                <li>Paper 9610043: Cited by 1,199 papers</li>
                <li>Paper 9510017: Cited by 1,155 papers</li>
                <li>Paper 9908142: Cited by 1,144 papers</li>
                <li>Paper 9503124: Cited by 1,114 papers</li>
                <li>Paper 9906064: Cited by 1,032 papers</li>
                <li>Paper 9408099: Cited by 1,006 papers</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <!-- PageRank Analysis -->
        <h3>2.2 PageRank Analysis</h3>
        <p>We apply the PageRank algorithm to identify influential papers based on both the number and quality of their citations. Papers with high PageRank scores, such as Paper 9407087 and Paper 9503124, serve as influential hubs within the network, connecting different research areas and helping disseminate foundational ideas.</p>

        <!-- Community Detection -->
        <h3>2.3 Community Detection</h3>
        <p>We use the Louvain method, a popular algorithm for community detection in complex networks, to identify groups of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network. The top five communities are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Community 12: 2,413 papers</li>
            <li>Community 1: 2,065 papers</li>
            <li>Community 7: 1,993 papers</li>
            <li>Community 0: 1,946 papers</li>
            <li>Community 14: 1,887 papers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chapter 4: Results and Insights</h2>
        
        <p>Our analysis confirms a strong concentration of influence within a small subset of highly cited papers. These core papers act as hubs that connect different parts of the network, driving research direction and facilitating knowledge dissemination.</p>

        <p>Conclusion: The HEP-TH citation network reveals a hierarchical structure where influence is concentrated within a small number of highly cited papers. This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the citation patterns, community structure, and influence dynamics within the HEP-TH field, shedding light on the interconnected nature of academic research in high-energy physics.</p>
